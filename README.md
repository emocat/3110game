For a full description of Six Packs and the project requirements, please see:

Our implementation of Six Packs includes the following features:

Users may enter 'skip' to skip the current question.
Users may enter 'give up' to view the answer to the current question.

The user's input is automatically converted to lowercase using the tolower() function.
The function uses the strstr function to check if the user's answer is found within the correct answer.

Therefore, if the correct answer is 'blue diamonds', an answer of 'blUE DIAmondSsssss' will still be marked correct.
